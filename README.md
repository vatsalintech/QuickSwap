# QuickSwap

This project modernizes traditional classified marketplaces by replacing chat-based price negotiations with a Real-Time Bidding (RTB) engine. Sellers list items with a soft starting price and a fixed bidding window, eliminating the need to manage multiple conversations while allowing the market to determine the final value automatically at auction close. Buyers participate in a transparent, competitive process where all bids are visible in real time, ensuring fair access and clear price discovery with no hidden commitments. By shifting from negotiation-driven chats to discovery-driven bidding, the platform compresses the lifecycle of a sale from days into minutes, bringing the efficiency and transparency of high-speed auction systems to local peer-to-peer marketplaces.
